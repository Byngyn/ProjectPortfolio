## Projects

### Project 1: Pokemon Project: VGC Metagame Analysis
- The purpose of this project is to create an interactive dashbaord using Power BI that filters by Pokemon, and generate visualizations that assist VGC competitive players to create a strategy. Firstly, SQL queries were created on an example dataset containing Pokemon statistics and characteristics to observe trends and figure out important/relevant data. Using this info, the necessary data can be extracted from the PokeAPI using Python. After cleaning, transforming, and modeling the data in Power BI, a dashboard was created to display certain stats, typings, possible movesets, and more.

### Project 2: SpaceX Analytical Report
- This is a capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. It is an end-to-end project where I take the role as a data scientist tasked with data cleaning, data transforming, visualizations, analysis and machine learning. The purpose of this project is to calculate the SpaceX rocket launch success rates based on certain factors. At the end of the project, a powerpoint was created to showcase our findings to business leaders and stakeholders. The data was taken from the SpaceX API, which was then transformed and loaded into .csv files. Data exploration was done in SQLite as well as Folium for gaining insights on geographical trends. Then, a dashboard app was created using Plotly and Dash to visualize the data. Finally, by utilizing sci-kit learn, we can predict the launch site success rates.

### Project 3: Data Survey PowerBI Breakdown
- A survey was taken by more than 600 data professionals to record their thoughts on the data industry, how happy they are with their job and salary, their favorite programming langauges, and more. Demographic information was also recorded in this survey. In order to clean the data, Power Query was used to correct data types and handle missing values. The visualizations in the dashboard consists of survey responses compared to certain demographics. For example, stacked column chart is favorite programming language by different data roles. There also also visualizations showing average age and happiness amoung participants.

### Project 4: Sales Management Analysis
- Given a business request and criteria from the sales department, I created a dashboard that gave on overview on sales per customer and per product. The AdventureWorks dataset is extracted and cleaned in SQL to create fact and dimension tables for data modeling. Once cleaned, the data is saved into .csv files for use in Power BI. To provide emphasis on certain sales trends, three dashboards were created in Power BI. The Sales Overview dashboard gives general insights on KPIs and trends based on customer or product details. The Customer Details and Product Details dashboards focused on sales per customer and sales per product.
