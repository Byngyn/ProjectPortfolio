## Projects

### Project 1: Pokemon Database SQL Querying
- In this VGC Analysis Project, I curated and meticulously cleaned an extensive database of Pokémon abilities and statistics sourced from PokéAPI, and developed an interactive Pokémon dashboard using PowerBI. To offer VGC players profound insights, I implemented a range of SQL queries that sifted through the data, uncovering hidden patterns and correlations. These queries facilitated informed decisions when selecting optimal Pokémon for battles.

### Project 2: SpaceX Analytical Report
- The SpaceX Mission Data Analysis Project was a data-driven initiative undertaken to support SpaceX's mission success and cost optimization efforts. I leveraged my knowledge in data analytics and machine learning to extract actionable insights from SpaceX mission data and launch statistics, ultimately found possible contributions to the enhancement of mission success rates and cost efficiency.
