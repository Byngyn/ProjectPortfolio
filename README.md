## Projects

### Project 1: Pokemon Project: VGC Metagame Analysis
- The purpose of this project is to create an interactive dashbaord using Power BI that filters by Pokemon, and generate visualizations that assist VGC competitive players to create a strategy. Firstly, SQL queries were created on an example dataset containing Pokemon statistics and characteristics to observe trends and figure out important/relevant data. Using this info, the necessary data can be extracted from the PokeAPI using Python. After cleaning, transforming, and modeling the data in Power BI, a dashboard was created to display certain stats, typings, possible movesets, and more.

### Project 2: SpaceX Analytical Report
- This is a capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. It is an end-to-end project where I take the role as a data scientist tasked with data cleaning, data transforming, visualizations, analysis and machine learning. The purpose of this project is to calculate the SpaceX rocket launch success rates based on certain factors. At the end of the project, a powerpoint was created to showcase our findings to business leaders and stakeholders. The data was taken from the SpaceX API, which was then transformed and loaded into .csv files. Data exploration was done in SQLite as well as Folium for gaining insights on geographical trends. Then, a dashboard app was created using Plotly and Dash to visualize the data. Finally, by utilizing sci-kit learn, we can predict the launch site success rates.

### Project 3: Data Survey PowerBI Breakdown
- A survey was taken by more than 600 data professionals to record their thoughts on the data industry, how happy they are with their job and salary, their favorite programming langauges, and more. Demographic information was also recorded in this survey. In order to clean the data, Power Query was used to correct data types and handle missing values. The visualizations in the dashboard consists of survey responses compared to certain demographics. For example, stacked column chart is favorite programming language by different data roles. There also also visualizations showing average age and happiness amoung participants.

### Project 4: Sales Management Analysis
- Given a business request and criteria from the sales department, I created a dashboard that gave on overview on sales per customer and per product. The AdventureWorks dataset is extracted and cleaned in SQL to create fact and dimension tables for data modeling. Once cleaned, the data is saved into .csv files for use in Power BI. To provide emphasis on certain sales trends, three dashboards were created in Power BI. The Sales Overview dashboard gives general insights on KPIs and trends based on customer or product details. The Customer Details and Product Details dashboards focused on sales per customer and sales per product.

### Project 5: Street Fighter AI
- This project was done in an Anaconda Environment, and used libraries such as Gym, Gym Retro, Optuna, and Stable Baselines3. A custom environment was created to start an instance of Street Fighter, record the score, preprocess the data, and implement the reward function. Then, optuna was used to study the optimization loop, which was created with Stable Baselines3. This is as hyper parameter tuning in order to get the best parameteres for training. Once the experiment is finished, the best performing trial's parameters are used to train the model, and Tensorboard was used to track its progress. Once finished, we can view the results by calling loading an instance of the best performing Street Fighter environment.

### Project 6: League of Legends Worlds 2022 Dashboard
- These dashboards were created to explore the data analytics side of esports suing SQL and Power BI. This dataset included extensive statistics of teams, players, and champions form the 2022 League World Championship. The data was first cleaned comprehensively in MS SQL Server to correct data type errors and standardizing column names.
Using this refined data, Power BI dashboards were made to provide insights on the most popular and best performing champions, players, and teams in the championship. Clustered bar charts were used to visualize and compare multiple, related stats at a glance. Standout performances and key insights were also highlighted for each page of the dashboard. A navigation bar was integrated, ensuring a seamless and intuitive experience for viewers.
