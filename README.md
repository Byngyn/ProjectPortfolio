## Projects

### Project 1: Pokemon Database SQL Querying
- In the Pokémon Database Query Project, I utilized a SQL-based solution to interact with a comprehensive Pokémon database and support competitive Pokémon players and enthusiasts in the Video Game Championships (VGC) scene. This project is dedicated to providing a comprehensive platform for querying and analyzing Pokémon data relevant to the VGC metagame, enabling players to make data-driven decisions in their competitive battles.
